# Triple Triad re-made with Godot

> *"How difficult it is to recreate the Triple Triad card game with the Godot Engine?"*

This repository is the answer to my question: the core of the game has been developed during [my Devember 2018 challenge](https://davcri.github.io/posts/devember2018-retrospective/) (a challenge where
you have to code each day of December for at least 1 hour).

---

## What is implemented

- Basic game mechanics:
   - Turns
   - Cards placement
   - "Capture" mechanic
- Data driven design for the `Card` node (all the data is taken from a JSON file)
- Simple AI

## How to run the game

### From an executable

You can download a prebuilt executable for Windows/OSX/Linux from the [release page](https://github.com/crystal-bit/triple-triad-godot/releases/latest).

### From source (using Godot)

1. [Download Godot Engine 3.2.1](https://godotengine.org/download/) 
2. Download this project
3. Launch Godot Engine
4. Import the project into Godot
   1. Select `Scan`
   2. Select the project folder
   3. Double click on Triple Triad
5. Run the game by clicking on the *Play* button (or use the <kbd>F5</kbd> key for a shortcut)!


## Input Controls

- `Arrow keys` to move the cursor
- `Space/Enter` to confirm

### Code contributions

Before working on anything, I want to make sure that no-one is working
on the same thing at the same time so please feel free to:

- [open an issue](https://github.com/crystal-bit/triple-triad-godot/issues/new)
- get in touch [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dav__cri) 

**Note**: I really would like to keep improving and expanding this
project, I love TripleTriad and would love to add other features (eg: online multiplayer matches)
but I don't have much time to invest on this project.  
I already did what I wanted: give an answer to the question that I wrote at the beginning of this 
file. 

## Licensing

I'm not an expert on licensing and this project is borderline legally speaking. I would say:

- every Godot related file (that I created) is released under MIT License:
  - scripts `*.gd`
  - scene files `*.tscn`
  - etc.
- the original asstes (textures, music, ecc.) should not be reused. They are Squaresoft/SquareEnix property. I don't even know if I'm allowed to use them.

## Thanks
